## 🧑‍💼 Usage

- **Players** press the configured key to access nearby shops.

- **Admins** use the configured command to create, edit, or delete shops.
- **NPCs** will dynamically simulate buyers and engage in item or weapon purchases.


### ♻️ Selling Items to Shops

- When **players sell** an item to a shop, that shop’s **`buy_quantity`** for the item **increases**.  
  *If you enforce an intake cap, the shop’s **`sell_quantity`** is reduced accordingly.*

- If the shop **didn’t have that item listed yet**, it’s added to the shop with **`buy_price = 0`**.  
  This lets shops **collect** items from players without instantly listing them for sale.

- An item becomes **buyable by customers** only when **both** are true:
  - `buy_quantity > 0`
  - `buy_price > 0`  
  If `buy_price` remains **0**, the item stays **hidden/unavailable** in the Buy menu even if the shop has stock.

- **Player-owned shops:** the amount paid to the seller is taken from the shop **ledger** — ensure sufficient funds to accept sales.  
  **NPC shops:** sellers are paid by the system; **no ledger required**.

- **Withdraw collected stock:** shop owners can open **Manage Items → Remove Items** and take any amount from the shop’s stock back into their inventory.
